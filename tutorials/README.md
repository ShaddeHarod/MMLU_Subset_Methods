# *tinyBenchmarks* tutorials

Welcome to the "*tinyBenchmarks* tutorials"! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the process of training your own IRT models, finding anchor points, and estimating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Getting Started

To get started with these tutorials, you need to first clone this repository to your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/felipemaiapolo/tinyBenchmarks.git
```

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the repository's directory:

```shell
cd tinyBenchmarks/tutorials
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Python 3.11.7 installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After ensuring you have the correct Python version, install all the required packages listed in `requirements.txt` using `pip`. Run the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are running `training_irt.ipynb`, install `py_irt` with our modifications  (check the original package [here](https://github.com/nd-ball/py-irt)). Start installing [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and then

```shell
git clone https://github.com/felipemaiapolo/py-irt.git
cd py-irt
poetry install
```


## Tutorials Overview

This repository contains three Jupyter notebooks that serve as tutorials:

1. **Training IRT Models (`training_irt.ipynb`):**
   - This notebook demonstrates how to train your own Item Response Theory (IRT) models. It covers the setup, training process, and evaluation of the models.

2. **Finding Anchor Points (`anchor_points.ipynb`):**
   - In this tutorial, we show how to identify anchor points from your training set. These anchor points are crucial for estimating the performance of new models on the test set.

3. **Estimating LLM Performance (`estimating_performance.ipynb`):**
   - This notebook guides you through the process of obtaining performance estimates for LLMs by combining the concepts of anchor points and IRT.

### Important Notes

- The `.py` files included in this repository are called inside the Jupyter notebooks and are not intended to be run separately. Make sure to follow the notebooks for the full tutorial experience.
